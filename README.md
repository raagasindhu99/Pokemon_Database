Pok√©mon UNITE Data Analytics Project
üïπÔ∏è Project Overview
The Pok√©mon UNITE Data Analytics Project focuses on uncovering insights from gaming data to enhance player experience and improve business outcomes. Despite the game‚Äôs success in downloads, it faces challenges in player retention and revenue growth. This project explores data-driven solutions to understand player behavior, identify trends, and recommend strategies for optimizing game mechanics, monetization, and customer satisfaction.

The primary objectives include:

Identifying player drop-off points and their impact on retention.
Understanding in-game purchase patterns to improve revenue streams.
Analyzing session behavior to optimize game design and player engagement.

üöÄ Use Case
Player Retention and Revenue Optimization
Pok√©mon UNITE needs actionable insights to address:

Declining active player counts and stagnant Revenue Per Download (RPD).
Challenges in converting high download rates into loyal paying users.
Through this project, the team can:

Pinpoint levels or events causing player disengagement.
Optimize rewards, mechanics, and in-game purchases to boost player retention and spending.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Techniques
MySQL
Database Management: Designed and implemented relational models to organize and query game data.
Key Queries: Insights into player behavior, Pok√©mon performance, and in-game purchases.
Python
Data Processing: Used Python for cleaning raw data, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis.
EDA Libraries: Leveraged pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data exploration and trend visualization.
Conceptual and UML Modeling
EER and UML Diagrams: Mapped game mechanics, player interactions, and relationships to visualize data flow and dependencies.
Normalization: Data was normalized up to 3.5NF to optimize relational design.

üìä Key Insights
Player Behavior Analysis:
High player drop-off after specific levels due to difficulty spikes.
